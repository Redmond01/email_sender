Hi {{FirstName}},

I’m {{Your Name}}, a solo developer who builds tools for small teams that are tired of juggling jobs in spreadsheets or sticky notes.

I’ve been following how folks like you — running real businesses on the ground (like construction, consulting, trades) — handle client scheduling, and I noticed a pattern: great work, but the system often holds things back.

So I built a simple booking & job tracking tool that helps service-based teams:

✅ Auto-schedule jobs without back-and-forth
✅ Sync with calendars & send reminders
✅ Cut no-shows and double-booking
✅ Works on mobile (no laptop needed)
It’s already helping a few small crews stay organized with less stress — and it’s built by someone who gets the hustle, not a corporate dev team.

If that sounds like something you could use, I’d love to show you how it works in a quick 10-minute call — no pitch, just a demo and your honest thoughts.

Would next [Tuesday/Thursday] work for a quick chat?

Best,
{{Your Full Name}}
Solo Developer 
P.S. Totally cool if it’s not the right time — just wanted to share something real that’s helping teams like yours.
