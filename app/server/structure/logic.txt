    challenge:
// key value pairs are clustered. 

// solution:
// 1.split the key using string methods
// 2.split the value using the string methods
// 3.check if the length of key matches value
// 4.take key[1] to match value[1]
// 5.create new object and add each to new key/value to a new object container using {...} syntax
// 6.pass the newly created object into an interface of (UserRecepient) type
